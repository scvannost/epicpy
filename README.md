A python wrapper for the EPIC cell type-identifying R library

Since http://epic.gfellerlab.org/ wasn't working for me and I didn't want to deal with R, I wrote a python wrapper for the R library that returns the cell type fractions using the default reference set of EPIC.
I am not in any way affiliated with the Gfeller lab or Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research Ltd.
